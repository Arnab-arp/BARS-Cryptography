If this is a scientific venture, I must say it is nearly impossible to select for all websites with uniform randomness (where each site has an equal probability of being selected.)

You would need to create a list of ALL (accessible) websites. I don’t think that a “world wide website registry” exists - a daunting project in its own right.

As an approximation (useful for certain purposes) you could use “wget” to automate a series of (say) 1000 google searches for a random set of words selected from the dictionary, perhaps 3 words per search. Each search would return (who knows) 5–50 “google-pages”

How do I crawl all websites to find everything that's available on the internet?

You won’t find everything that’s available on the Internet, because most of the Internet is behind paywalls and/or user accounts and/or has few or no inbound links or isn’t even on the Web.

But the basic idea is this:

    Create two lists of links, one for visited links, and one for not-visited links.
    Insert a link into the not-visited list.
    Pick a not-visited link from the not-visited list.
    Download the content from the site at the link and put it somewhere useful.
    Move the link from the not-visited list to the visited list.
    Extract all the links found in the content downloaded in Step 4.

How can I view a random web page within a website?

This isn't always possible. Some sites like Abstruse Goose

name each page/post with the post number, so using any random number between 1 and the latest post number in the URL serves the purpose. Seth's Blog, however, seems to use custom permalinks so it's not possible without a dedicated option for the purpose.

How do I open a large number of random web pages automatically?

    You could do various Google and Yahoo searches and open the 1st, 10th, 100th, 1000th and 10000th result for each of these searches.
    You could use StumbleUpon

    and open the first 100 pages it shows you.
    Do a search on Wikipedia, click on the first related page, repeat 20 times, open the first external link, repeat.
    Do a search in a language you don’t know by typing anything, open the first result, repeat.

Originally Answered: How do I access the dark or deep web hear about so often?

You access the deep web by logging on to Quora or Facebook or going to your bank account page. The deep web is just anything you can’t reach from a search engine. Your Edit Profile page on Quora and your bank account page are both deep web.

You access the dark web by downloading a special browser, the most common of which is TOR.

Download Tor

Be prepared for disappointment. The breathless, superstitious hype isn’t true. You won’t find live-streaming murder rooms; the TOR network is too slow to allow live streaming (that was the plot of a Japanese horror movie, not reality). You won’t find hit men

What is the most anonymous way, as practically possible, to browse the Internet?

Buy a cheap computer, tablet, etc… wipe the software clean (factory reset, fresh install). Then never, ever… input your name or personal info into anything… don’t login to any accounts, don’t buy anything (using your shipping info, bill to info), etc. It’s the software you have to “fear” the most… especially if you don’t understand it. And it’s tricky, doing things you never knew was possible (or likely).

Or… you could learn the technology better… and turn off cookies, and tracking ID’s, marketing (ad) ID’s, etc. But software is sneaky, it’ll probably “outsmart” you. Or just cheat.

What was the weirdest website you found while surfing the deep web or the dark web?

I’ve come across quite a few weird websites on the dark web over my three years exploring Tor and other such networks.

One of the strangest (or at least most mysterious) sites, in my opinion, was entitled “WHY?”, and consisted of this image:

I know it’s hard to tell what that is, but if you visit the site, there’s what looks like a woman in a white dress walking through the woods in the middle of the page. The actual link is http://b2xm6w4eua5tpanu.onion/

.

She kind of reminded me of the girl from The Ring:

While there are various website randomizers available online, it's important to prioritize safe and anonymous browsing. Using a website randomizer can help protect your privacy by accessing websites through different IP addresses.
However, for a more secure and reliable option, consider using morelogin. Morelogin provides secure browsing with anonymous IPs that are not logged, ensuring your activities remain private and anonymous. By utilizing morelogin, you can access websites through multiple logins in different tabs within your browser, effectively randomizing your IP address for each login

Oh, it’s my favorite topic! (Note: I haven’t been writing about this on Quora as much because Quora was removing a bunch of my answers related to it.)

In essence, what people are referring to as the dark web are a series of anonymity networks, the most popular of which is called Tor.

Tor (The Onion Router) is both a network and a browser, which I realize can be confusing. The Tor Browser is a modified version of Firefox, which is optimized for anonymity and security:

Before Silk Road got taken down, I would occasionally go browsing just to see what was being offered. There was some pretty sick stuff. Like, murder for hire, kidnapping, child sex rings.

Some person, I’m assuming it was a guy, wanted people (they did not specify male or female) to sell him their used UNCLEANED sex toys. He was offering anywhere from $50USD-$200USD in bitcoin, depending on the toy, the amount of use/aroma/stickiness…. Just reading the ad made me almost puke. Never visited that section of the

How do I access the dark web with ease?

First off a word of warning, the Dark web is not something to take lightly it is a dangerous place that houses dangerous people with malicious intent.

Also for myself I in no way endorse use of the Dark Web or any material hosting on it.

You’ll need a special browser, such as Tor browser, to view and access the websites located on the Dark web. Make sure to always have Javascript “Scripts” disabled EVERYWHERE! Some sites will have built in scripts to find your IP/location and you don’t want Murderers, Hackers or even the Police to have that (depending on your intent on the Dark web).

How can I view a random web page within a website?

If you want to view a random web page within a specific website, one way to do this is by using a search engine with the "site:" operator. Here are the steps to follow:

    Go to your preferred search engine (e.g. Google, Bing, etc.) and type "site:[website domain]" followed by a space and then an asterisk (*). For example, if you want to view a random web page on the Wikipedia website, you would type "site:wikipedia.org *". This will instruct the search engine to show you all pages on the website.

How do I access the dark web and not the deep web?

Depends which dark web you want to access. There are many, the three largest being Tor, I2P, and Freenet.

When most people say “the dark web,” they mean Tor. You access Tor by downloading and installing the Tor browser.

When internet was born in early 90s, there were a few websites and we’re able to look around them just by hyperlink tunneling. There was few way to navigate the web except hyperlink tunneling. (Google was born in 1999.) At that time, people regarded hyperlink tunneling as cool and dynamic activity like ‘surfing’.

How do I browse the Internet privately?

When you surf the web using Chrome or any other browser, your computer saves some of the data on websites you’re visiting as part of your browser history. Chrome doesn’t need to collect that data, particularly if you want to surf the web more anonymously.

Here’s how to browse the web without being tracked.

Use a VPN

A VPN, or virtual private network, allows you to connect to the internet in a more secure manner and helps to prevent others on the same network from seeing what you’re doing.

How do I surf the dark web anonymously?

Well it depends on what you are doing.

To be anonymous you will just need to use TOR since its designed to scramble IP's bouncing your location and making a onion sort of “protection”

Now yes it is a very high risk of being caught now since people and law enforcement are getting smarter.

I would recommend using a Linux computer that has no files whatsoever. Then to be safe a virtual machine inside it.

From there I would recommend:

No webcams, No microphones, Encrypted Internet ( Spoofer/Ghoster) and a stronger program then TOR. (Won't list any programs due to security)
